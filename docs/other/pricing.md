# Pricing

!!! success "How much does it cost?"
    Kodular is **FREE**!

Kodular Creator is completely free of charge. You can use it for whatever you want, and we will never ask you to pay us.

We wanted it like that so anyone could convert their desired ideas into apps in a simple way. We think that everybody should have the right to create apps even without knowing to code. That is why our platform is free and it will remain like that forever.

This also extends to Kodular Store and Kodular Extensions IDE.

## Commissions

However, to keep our services for free, we take a small comission from your earnings in ads. We do not force nobody to place ads in apps, but if you want to earn money, we take a percentage of your earnings.

The components we take commissions from are **only** AdMob ones (_AdMob Banner_, _AdMob Interstitial_ and _AdMob Rewarded Video_). The other ones are free of commissions.

The percentage of your earnings we take varies from a basic 5% up to a 20%, depending on the number of features you use in your app. For example, if an app with AdMob Ads is very simple, we will only take the 5% of those earnings. But if the app uses all our components and features, the commission will be of 20%

You do not have to worry about paying us the correct percentage. We already take it automatically from your AdMob & AdSense earnings, reducing your work.

## Premium Plan

Since time ago, we have said that [Kodular Creator will not have a Premium Plan](https://community.kodular.io/t/premium-plan-nope/709). This also extends to Kodular Store.

But the Extensions IDE will have a Premium Plan. Currently available features will not disappear or stop offering. We will only develop new features for the Premium Plan, for example removing the waiting queue or uploading custom libraries.
