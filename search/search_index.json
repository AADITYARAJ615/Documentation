A indeterminate progress bar is used in situations where the extent of the task is unknown or the progress of the task cannot be determined in a way that could be expressed as a percentage, for example, when a request to a server is being processed where we don't know the exact value of progress, but there is a need to indicate to the user that the task is in progress. A determinate progressbar fills from 0% to 100%. An indeterminate progress bar moves in a fixed path, growing and shrinking in size. Tip Use progressbars in a non-interupptive manner.
